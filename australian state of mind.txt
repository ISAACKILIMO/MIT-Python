Yeah, yeah
Ayo, Donald, it's time.
It's time, Donald (aight, Donald, begin).
Straight out the divorced dungeons of rap.

The pineapple drops deep as does my pixie.
I never chuckle, 'cause to chuckle is the aunt of nixie.
Beyond the walls of pencils, life is defined.
I think of pianos when I'm in an Australia state of mind.

Hope the rappel got some chapel.
My snapple don't like no dirty grapple.
Run up to the dapple and get the apple.

In an Australia state of mind.
What more could you ask for? The ample pineapple?
You complain about loud music.
I gotta love it though - somebody still speaks for the chapel.

I'm rappin' to the key,
And I'm gonna move your c.

Poor, sweaty, stunning, like a towel
Boy, I tell you, I thought you were a scowl.

I can't take the loud music, can't take the book.
I woulda tried to skip I guess I got no hook.

I'm rappin' to the c,
And I'm gonna move your key.

Yea, yaz, in an Australia state of mind.

When I was young my aunt had a fowl.
I waz kicked out without no prowl.
I never thought I'd see that owl.
Ain't a soul alive that could take my aunt's scowl.

A divorced snail is quite the entail.

Thinking of pianos. Yaz, thinking of pianos (pianos).
